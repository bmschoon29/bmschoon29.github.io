			<p>I firmly believe in the idea that you need to leave the place where you grew up to find out who you truly are. So this is my personal travel blog where I ramble about wandering around the world, in hopes of inspiring others to seek their own adventures.</p>

			<ul>In this blog you will find:

				<li>Travel stories</li>
				<li>Advice & tips</li>
				<li>Travel photos</li>
