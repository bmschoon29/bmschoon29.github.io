			<h2>TRAVEL. 
			<br>AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.</h2>
			<p>As silly as it sounds, I firmly believe that you need to leave the place where you grew up to find out who you truly are.</p> 
			<p>So this is my personal travel blog where I ramble about wandering around the world, in hopes of inspiring others to seek their own adventures.</p>


			<ul><h3>WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?</h3>

				<li>Travel stories</li>
				<li>Advice & tips</li>
				<li>Travel photos</li>
				<li>& more adventures I'm working on!</li>
