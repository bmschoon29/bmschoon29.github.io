			<h2>TRAVEL.
			<br>AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.</h2>
			<br>
			<img src="images/airplane.jpg" alt="Airplane">
			<p>As silly as it sounds, I firmly believe that you need to leave the place where you grew up to really learn about yourself.
			<br>
			<br>
			My travels have helped shape who I am and not only taught me more about other cultures, but my own as well.
			<br> 
			<br>
			Although there are so many more places I want to see, the experiences I have had so far have changed the way I live my life and view the world.
			<br>
			<br>
			So this is my personal travel blog where I ramble about wandering around the world, in hopes of inspiring others to seek their own adventures.

			<h3>WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?</h3>
				<br>
				<p>On this blog I talk about my travel stories, advice and tips I have for traveling, photos & more adventures I'm working on. 
				<br>
				<br>
				As much as I like to talk about all things travel, I will occasionally include other lifestyle content.</p>
